    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
